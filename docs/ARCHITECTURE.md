# Game Core Architecture

## Scope

Game Core is a reusable runtime library for shared HTML5 game systems. It is organized as a small `CoreRuntime` kernel plus independent runtime modules registered into it:

- `CoreRuntime` — a fan-out orchestrator: registers named runtime modules, ticks them all through one `update(frameMs)` call, fans out scope cancellation/pause/resume, aggregates stats, and gives every module's failures one error-reporting boundary. It never renders and never knows a module's internals.
- `FxRuntime` (module name `"fx"`) — effect lifecycle, pooled node acquisition and release, trajectories and easing, impact/completion/cancellation callbacks, cleanup and diagnostics.
- `MotionRuntime` (module name `"motion"`) — numeric tween/delay/sequence scheduling over host-supplied bindings, for UI/game motion that isn't pooled FX.

The host owns rendering, asset loading, DOM, canvases, application objects, and tickers, and is the only thing that ever calls `CoreRuntime.update(frameMs)`.

## Core Runtime

`CoreRuntime` registers runtime modules under a stable name and fans out to all of them:

```ts
core.registerRuntime('fx', fxRuntime);
core.registerRuntime('motion', motionRuntime);
core.update(frameMs);          // ticks every registered module
core.cancelScope(scope);       // sums cancelled counts across modules that support it
core.pauseScope(scope);
core.resumeScope(scope);
core.getStats();               // { fx: {...}, motion: {...} }
```

A module's own `cancelScope`/`cancelAll`/`pauseScope`/`resumeScope`/`getStats`/`dispose` are all optional — `CoreRuntime` skips a module that doesn't implement one, rather than requiring every module to support everything. If a module throws from any of these, `CoreRuntime` catches it, reports it through the single handler registered via `onError`, and every other registered module keeps working. A throwing error handler can never itself escape into the host's own ticker.

## FX Runtime

`FxRuntime` updates all active effects through one host-driven call:

```ts
const changed = fxRuntime.update(frameMs);
```

`true` means a visible FX state changed and the host can render its own FX surface. `false` means nothing changed. The runtime never starts `requestAnimationFrame`, never creates a rendering application, and never calls render.

## Surface Boundary

The runtime targets `FxSurface` and opaque `FxNode` objects. It only needs:

- `attach`
- `detach`
- `setPosition`
- `setScale`
- `setRotation`
- `setAlpha`
- `setVisible`

The Pixi adapter uses a small duck-typed display object subset compatible with PixiJS 7 and PixiJS 8. The production bundle does not include PixiJS.

## Pooling

`FxPool` is fully configurable by the host:

- `createNode`
- `prewarm`
- `maxSize`

Release detaches the node and resets visibility, alpha, transform, and position. Nodes are reused instead of destroyed during normal effect sequences when prewarmed capacity is sufficient.

## Effects

Version 0.1 includes two generic primitives:

- `projectile`: quadratic Bezier movement with delay, scale/alpha keyframes, optional trajectory rotation, impact callback, and completion callback.
- `radialBurst`: pooled radial particles with configurable start radius, travel distance, jitter, scale, alpha, duration, and scope.

## Diagnostics

`FxRuntime.getStats()` reports:

- active effects
- pool acquires
- pool releases
- pool misses
- created nodes
- dropped effects
- last update time
- max update time

Stats can be reset through `resetStats()`.

## Motion Runtime

`MotionRuntime` schedules numeric tweens, delays, and simple tween/delay sequences over host-supplied bindings — it has no concept of a node, a renderer, or a specific engine:

```ts
type MotionBinding = {
  get(): number;
  set(value: number): void;
  to: number;
  from?: number;
};
```

A host describes *what number to move and where to*; `MotionRuntime` only ever calls `get()`/`set()` on the bindings it's given. It never imports Pixi, GSAP, or Cocos, and never creates a ticker or `requestAnimationFrame` — like `FxRuntime`, it only advances through a host-driven `update(frameMs)` call, normally reached via `CoreRuntime.update(frameMs)`.

Three operation kinds: `tween` (interpolates one or more bindings, with optional easing, delay, repeat/yoyo), `delay` (a first-class timed wait, not `setTimeout`), and `sequence` (an ordered list of tween/delay steps that behaves as a single cancellable operation to the host). All three return a `MotionHandle` (`cancel`/`pause`/`resume`/`active`/`paused`) — no Promise API in this version.

A binding whose `get()`/`set()` throws (a stale or destroyed host object) cancels only that one operation; every other active motion is unaffected. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-motion-runtime-v0.2-design.md` for the full design.
